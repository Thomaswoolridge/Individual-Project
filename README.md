# Individual-Project
This is a text-based game for my individual project, it is called Adventure: The Text Based Journey. This is an adventure game about an explorer that has been hired to find treasure. The user will go on a journey with risks and rewards. If you play just right there is even a bonus round. I tested my project by making one piece at at time and testing it as I went. When the program got really big I made another file to test blocks of code without having to play the entire game over again. I had to test my loops many times. I learned the best way to format my print functions so I didn't have to type print() one thousand times. The new Python feature I used was random to generate a random number of years of experience for the user's character. I also used the random feature for the bonus round to pick from a list of outcomes. The challenges I faced were getting my loops to funtion properly, getting ascii art to output to the console, and figuring out the random function. I overcame the issues with my loops by using my old assignments and info posted on canvas, I was able to overcome my issues with ascii art and the random feature by using google. Through google I was able to learn that the print funtion can be modified to print symbols that normally couldn't be output. I learned that a program for a game like this can get really big really fast. I think I could have added more but then the game would be too long.
